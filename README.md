#  Retail Sales Analysis & Product Recommendation  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior and predicts seasonal demand using machine learning techniques. Additionally, it implements a recommendation system to enhance customer experience.  

##  Key Features  
-  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
-  **Sales Trend Analysis & Visualization**  
-  **Machine Learning-based Demand Forecasting (SARIMA, ARIMA, statsmodels)**  
-  **Customer Segmentation & Behavior Analysis**  
-  **Product Recommendation System**  

##  Dataset  
I used the **Online Retail Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and real-world sales data from Amazon/eBay.  

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn)  
- **Time Series Forecasting** (ARIMA, SARIMA, statsmodels)  
- **Recommendation System** (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
- **Visualisation** (seaborn, matplotlib) 

## How to Run the Project  
### Run Data Preprocessing
python data_cleaning.py

### Analyze Customer Data
python customer_analysis.py

###   Identify Sales Trends & Forecast Demand
python sales_trends.py

### Generate Product Recommendations
python recommendation_system.py

### Future Improvements

Add deep learning-based forecasting models (LSTM, Transformer)
Integrate real-time sales tracking
Deploy recommendation system as an API
