# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis & Product Recommendation  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior and predicts seasonal demand using machine learning techniques. Additionally, it implements a recommendation system to enhance customer experience.  

## 📊 Key Features  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- 📈 **Sales Trend Analysis & Visualization**  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning-based Demand Forecasting (SARIMA, ARIMA, Prophet)**  
- 🎯 **Customer Segmentation & Behavior Analysis**  
- 🔍 **Product Recommendation System**  

## 📂 Dataset  
We used the **Online Retail Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and real-world sales data from Amazon/eBay.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- **Time Series Forecasting** (statsmodels, Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA)  
- **Recommendation System** (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)  
- **SQL** (MySQL, PostgreSQL for data storage)  
- **Visualization** (Tableau, Power BI)  

## How to Run the Project  
### Install Dependencies
